Feature: adding new account
 
  As an accountant
  So that I can serve more customers
  I want to be able to add new accounts for them
  

Scenario: add new account
	Given I am on the create account page
	When I fill in "account_name" with "Bank"
	And I fill in "account_type" with "assests"
	And I press "submit"
	Then the account should be added
	And I should go to show account page
