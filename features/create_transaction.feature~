Feature: creating transaction
  As an accountant
  So that I can transfer money from account to another
  I want to be able to make transactions between accounts
  
Background: movies have been added to database
  
  Given the following accounts exist:
  | name            | balance | account_type | 
  | assets_account1 | 1000    | Asset        |
  | assets_account2 | 1000    | Asset        |
  | equity_account  | 1000    | Equity       |

  And I am on new transactions page


Scenario: create valid transaction
	When I select "assets_account1" from "transaction_account1"
	And I select "equity_account" from "transaction_account2"
	And I select "to" from "transaction_dir1"
	And I select "to" from "transaction_dir2"
	And I fill in "amount" with "500"
	And I fill in "description" with "transaction_test"
	And I press "submit"
	Then I should go to show transactions page
	And I should see "transaction_test"
	And I should see "500.0"
